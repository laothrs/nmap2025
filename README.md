# nmap2025

nmap2025 is a modern and lightweight port scanner written in Python. It is built to provide a fast, asynchronous, and extensible approach to network scanning. Unlike traditional scanners, nmap2025 utilizes low-level packet manipulation with Scapy, allowing for deeper inspection and custom probing techniques.

The tool is ideal for security researchers, penetration testers, and system administrators who require detailed visibility into network services.

Key highlights:
- Asynchronous scanning for increased speed and efficiency
- Custom TCP SYN scanning using Scapy
- Banner grabbing capabilities
- Detection of IP ID and TCP timestamp information
- Multilingual output support (English and Turkish)
- Command-line interface with rich argument options
- JSON-formatted results for easy parsing

nmap2025 is designed to be minimal, modular, and easily adaptable to various scanning scenarios. It aims to offer deeper insight than conventional port scanners while remaining scriptable and user-friendly.
